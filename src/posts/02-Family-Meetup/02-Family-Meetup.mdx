Finally, its starting to feel a little safer to get out and travel amidst COVID-19 concerns.  So we called up our family in NC and invited them to meet us in the GA mountains.  The grandparents finally get to see their grandchildren after months of being apart.

While GA and SC state parks have reopened, they are not taking new reservations at their campgrounds, and SC state parks are not taking new reservations until 11 May.  So, despite our preference for state parks, we were forced to look at possibilities among private campgrounds.  We were able to find the beautiful [Riverbend Campground](https://www.riverbendcamping.com/) in Hiawasee, GA.  Riverbend Campground is very spacious, incredibly well kept, and is bordered on three sides by the Hiawasee River.

Getting out gave the family a great opportunity to get the kids outside and setup camp right next to my parents 40ft Fifth-Wheel and share a great week of visiting.

## Getting Out!

Hiawasee, GA is in the middle of the Chattahoochie National Forest, and provides a number of great outdoors activities.  Unfortunately, because it is federal property, many opportunties were still closed.  The first hike we sought, was to visit Brasstown Bald, the highest point in Georgia.  We intended to drive to the visitor center at the top of the mountain, and take a shorter hike which was more conducive to young kids... unfortunately the road to the top was closed.  Fortunately, there was a parking area at the bottom of the mountain at the "Jack's Gap" trailhead, which leads to the top of the mountain.  We were not able to hike the entire route, but did have a great time hiking about 4 miles total out-and-back, and take advantage of some of the views of the North Georgia mountains.

The next big hike were able to take was at the "Jackrabbit" Mountain Bike/Hiking trail on Lake Chatuge.  The area has a number of trail options, but the main Central Loop trail maintains regular placards on the plants and trees in the area.  It was a great opportunity to have conversations with the kids about different plants and how to recognize them.  The routes were very well maintained, wide, and trail placards with maps were at every main junction to aid navigation.  I look forward to returning with mountain bikes to explore more of the area

## Challenges

Internet... its not just an ammenity these days.  We don't need it for social media browsing and movie sites (though we like to endulge as much as the next family), we need it to maintain a mobile lifestyle.  Riverbend campground offers patrons Wifi, but with a limitation to two static devices per campsite, and with very limited bandwidth.  This was an obvious problem with Sophie and I attempting to work, and three school age kids each with computers attempting to accomplish schoolwork.

The search for a mobile internet solution is on.  We have already enabled hotspots on our phones, but data signal did not exist at the campground (though there were strong signals in the nearby town of Hiawasee).  

It seems the major options are some sort of cellular solution, which will be limited by the same reception challenges posed by phones, and a satellite solution, which initial research suggests weather and terrain related challenges as well a high cost.  This is a problem we will be working through as we continue prepping for long trips which will include stops in remote locations.

We look forward to solving this problem as we continue our preparations for a summer on the road.
