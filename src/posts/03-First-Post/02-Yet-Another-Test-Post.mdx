# First Blog Post

Welcome to the 6+aHitch Blog.  We are a family of six with a dream to travel the country in with a camper and adventure as a family.  Im Ben, a recently separated Army veteran who left after 11 years of service to pursue more time with my family, and my beautiful wife is Sophie, a successful health and wellness consultant and shameless handstander...

Our dream is travel and adventure, and to share the experience with our 4 kids.

## OK, then just do it...

Of course, if its right for the family, and its a priority, then just hit the road... right...  But any parent knows there are a million barriers to overcome. For us, it is homeschooling our kids, which is seems incredibly intimidating.  Then there is aligning work to afford such a "lavish" lifestyle.  Then there is an endless list of questions to figure out like: what camper, what vehicles, how do you {fill in the blank with anyting related to finding and setting up a campsite with a camper without breaking something}, how do I deal with {fill in the blank with whatever disaster will inevitably happen}... and the list goes on.

## Why now?

As I mentioned, homeschooling is the biggest hurdle to overcome.  The outbreak of COVID-19 led to forced homeschooling, with the fortunate support of an entire school system.  This happening spurred us to finally take the leap and buy a camper, and start pursuing our dream.

## So now what?

The startup has been hampered, we were able to get our fist trip to Mistletoe State Park, Georgia for a test run 3 days after buying our camper ( we'll discuss our rig in future posts)... but state parks closed down a couple days later, and our launch literally had the brakes thrown.  State parks typically provide more space between campsites than private campgrounds, and we are concerned about navigating the COVID-19 environment responsibly, so we waited.

We just completed out second test run to Hiawasee, Georgia to meet family for a week.  Now we will complete some administrative preparations, and our next trip will be underway.  Future posts will discuss the highlights of all the challenges we overcome (including the non-descript administrative preparations).

### We hope that by sharing the real challenges we face, we encourage others to chase their dream.

Its not easy, it is scary, but it is worth it to show our kids the world.

Here we tow!
